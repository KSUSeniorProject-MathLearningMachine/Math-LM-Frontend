# MathLearningMachine

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Contributing
To add a new feature, please branch off of development branch with a new feature branch. The development branch should remain stable.

All new features will be built into src/lib. Each page or major set of features will be a separate module composed of components, services, and additional information needed (constants, interfaces, enumerators, etc.). It is hugely helpful to use the Angular CLI to generate every new module/components/service/etc. as it will create all the file you need as well as linking them together (see Code scaffolding section).

To contribute to this repository, you will need Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the Angular CLI (https://cli.angular.io/)

This app will be developed using: 
* Angular 10
* Typescript 4 (sorry Python users, only strongly typed languages here)
* SCSS (Following the BEM styling standard http://getbem.com/naming/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
